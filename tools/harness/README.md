# The desktop harness

Runs the app's **whole native engine** (`app/src/main/cpp/native-lib.cpp` with the FM
demodulator, the aligner, the blend, RDS and libnrsc5) on a PC against an IQ recording -
no phone, no dongle. It is how every DSP step of HiDef Radio was tested, and it is a small
example of driving the engine outside Android.

    cd tools/harness
    sh build.sh                      # Linux / macOS: git, cmake, gcc, clang++, a JDK (for jni.h)
    IQFILE=klos.cu8 IQPACE=1 WAVOUT=out.wav build/apptest 95500000 2 34

- `IQFILE`  a `.cu8` recording at 1,488,375 samples/s - exactly what `nrsc5 -w file.cu8 95.5 0` writes.
- `IQPACE=1` plays it in real time (needed for anything that depends on timing: Auto, the blend).
  Without it the file runs as fast as possible.
- `WAVOUT`  saves the audio the app would play (16-bit stereo, 44.1 kHz).
- `CALLS`   the call letters licensed on that frequency, as the app's FCC list gives them
  (`CALLS="KGGI KJNY KSQL"`), for the rules that turn an RDS code into a station name.
  Not set = no list.
- `GAIN=auto` starts with the app's auto-gain search (default: a manual gain of 30 dB).
- `DONGLE=V3` the fake dongle says it is an RTL-SDR Blog V3 (R820T tuner): on AM it reports
  direct sampling, and the app must then leave the tuner gain alone.
- arguments: frequency in Hz, source (`0` Digital only, `1` Analog only, `2` Auto), seconds,
  then optional events `t:prog:N` (switch to program N at t seconds; 0 = HD1) and `t:src:N`.

It prints one status line every 0.25 s (sync, alignment, blend state) plus the app's own log lines.

How it works: `rtl_stub.c` is a fake librtlsdr that "receives" the file, `fftw3.h` is a tiny
stand-in for FFTW, `apptest.cpp` includes `native-lib.cpp` and calls its JNI functions with a
fake `JNIEnv`. nrsc5, FAAD2 and the librtlsdr headers are downloaded into `build/`.

`blendtest` (`build/blendtest`) tests `blend.hpp` alone with made-up audio.
